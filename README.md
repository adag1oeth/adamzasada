- 👋 Hi, I’m Adam Zasada aka [adag1oeth](https://www.x.com/adag1oeth "adag1oeth")
- 👀 I’m a founder of [Soul Agents](https://www.x.com/adag1oeth "Soul Agents") and an ex-founder of [0xKYC](https://www.x.com/0xKYCinc "0xKYC") (open-source decentralized identity protocol backed by Outlier Ventures, BuffiCorn Ventures and Celestia's CTO, amongst other angels 😇)
- 🌱 I’m coding in TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, using MongoDB and Vector databases, and have extensive knowledge about Engineering Management, Web3 tech, building banks (including. Bank as a Service infrastructure for e.g. Revolut), and in general I am a little bit all over the place; fun fact: I've been the youngest coding student at PJWSTK (now PJATK, a leading technology university in Warsaw, Poland) at the age of 12, and I've also been a resident DJ at Cafe Mambo in Ibiza and played with Adam Port, Solomun, Tiga, Bicep and others... 
- 💞️ I’m building autonomous A.I. agents with our team at [Soul Agents](https://www.x.com/adag1oeth "Soul Agents"), and I've even won a hackathon (3rd place) with my code - you can see it in my [trading](https://www.github.com/adamzasada/trading "trading") repo.
- 📫 You can also reach me on: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/azasada/ "LinkedIn")

Also experienced as Hinkal's (leading privacy protocol) Ecosystem and Product Lead, and from other notable startups.
